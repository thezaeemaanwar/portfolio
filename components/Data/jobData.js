			"During my time at Arbisoft, I had the opportunity to weave magic into a variety of projects. Whether it was crafting sleek mobile pages that danced to life with React and Styled Components, or breathing new efficiency into legacy systems like the Badges App on the edX platform, I took pride in every line of code. My efforts didn’t just end with aesthetics; I also fortified backend processes, like integrating Google SSO for secure user authentication and implementing OpenPGP encryption to keep data safe.",
			"One of my most memorable quests involved building a powerful form builder for customer satisfaction surveys, complete with real-time previews and detailed analytics, ensuring every piece of feedback was captured with precision. I also architected a scalable Django-based school application and created intuitive analytics dashboards that made data visualization feel like second nature. ",

The Shop Section became a sanctuary of NFC card enchantments, while the swift magic of business card scanning summoned VCF files with a flicker. Profile sharing? A mere whisper of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript sent links fluttering through the wind. And with the Stripe API, e-commerce flowed as seamlessly as a spell, securing the way.
